# Lacking GL

Lacking GL provides a native OpenGL implementation of the [lacking](https://github.com/mokiat/lacking) framework's APIs.

**WARNING:** This project has been deprecated in favour of [lacking-native](https://github.com/mokiat/lacking-native), which supports more platforms (also MacOS) and does not assume a particular technology.
